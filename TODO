 a. Characters
   Json: 
    "anya-forger":
     {
       Hp: 100, 
       Attack: 10,
       flavor-text: "She is the adopted daughter of Loid and Yor Forger. She attends Eden Academy as a first-year student in Cecile Hall, Class 3."
       fighting-ability: "Able to dodge 65% of attacks"
       food-ability: "Hp + 20 boost when included peanuts"
       cooking-difficulty: "normal"
     }

Feeding:
  - Characters lose 10% to 30% of their current HP every in-game day (or set interval) if not fed.
  - Hunger state: After a certain time without food, characters enter a "hungry" state, increasing HP loss rate (e.g., doubles the percentage loss).
  - Underfeeding consequences:
      - Prolonged hunger applies debuffs: reduced Attack (–20–50%), lower dodge chance, slower reaction in cooking mini-games.
      - If HP reaches 0 from hunger or battle, the character "dies" permanently and is removed from the player's roster indefinitely.
      - Reviving a dead character requires repurchasing them with Stella points at full cost (no discounts).
  - Meals and recovery:
      - All characters can eat any meal; there are no character-specific food restrictions (except for special bonuses).
      - Food restores HP as a percentage of the character's maximum HP (e.g., +15%, +25%, +40%), preventing over-healing beyond natural limits.
      - Meals do not have fixed HP values; recovery scales with the eater's max HP and meal quality.
      - Stocked food: Players can feed characters at any time from inventory stock.
        - If a character is hungry and not manually fed, they will auto-consume a random basic food item from stock (if available) to satisfy hunger, but with reduced effectiveness (half the normal % restore).
  - Meal quality tiers:
      - Terrible: –10% to –30% HP (poison effect), possible additional debuffs.
      - Poor: +5–10% HP restore.
      - Normal: +15–25% HP restore.
      - Good: +30–40% HP restore.
      - Excellent: +50% HP restore + temporary buffs (e.g., +Attack or +dodge for next battle).
  - Special character interactions:
      - Yor’s cooking: Default quality is usually "Terrible" (high chance of HP loss) unless she cooks her childhood stew recipe (from the cruise arc), which becomes "Excellent" for the Forger family (+extra family bond buff).
      - Character-specific bonuses still apply on top of meal quality (e.g., Anya gets extra +10% from any meal containing peanuts, Yuri gains more from Yor’s cooking even if terrible).
  - Cooking system:
      - Cooking is a mini-game based on timing, memory, and reaction (e.g., rhythm-based button presses, sequence recall, quick-time events).
      - Outcome depends on:
        - Cook's "cooking-difficulty" rating (easy = forgiving timings/large success window, normal = standard, hard = very tight timings).
        - Recipe complexity.
        - Ingredients used (better/rarer ingredients improve potential quality ceiling).
      - Players can cook for each other: Assign any owned character as the cook for a meal.
      - Co-op cooking possible with multiple characters for better results (but riskier if one has hard difficulty).
  - Inventory management:
      - Ingredients and prepared meals are stored separately.
      - Stock sorted by type: Ingredients, Prepared Meals, Special Items.
      - Auto-sorting option available; spoiled or expired items (if time mechanic added) are removed or reduce quality.
