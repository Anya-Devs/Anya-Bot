### Command Details

####  [`...quest`](#quest)
The `...quest` command allows users to start new quests or check the progress of their ongoing quests. This is the heart of the game mechanics, where players interact with different quests to earn rewards (stella points). It encourages players to actively participate in the server and interact with other members. Anya wants you to make new friends and be active in the community so donâ€™t be shy! ðŸ˜‰ .

####  [`...shop`](#shop)
The ...shop command lets players view the shop's available items so they can create their own spy tools. These tools allow you to acquire roles in the server and more, making it fun and rewarding to stay active. The setup is simple and easy, making you feel like an actual craftsman. Anya always wanted a pistol with a silencer; now you can create your very own, along with other items she desires.

####  [`...inventory`](#inventory)
With `...inventory`, users can see all the items they have collected throughout their quests and purchases. Being a spy is all about stealth, and each item has its own interactive ID. When you use the ID, it allows you to interact with the item or with other users. Quite exciting (very waku waku)! The layout is sleek and easy to follow, ensuring you feel like a top spyâ€”organized and prepared to handle a bunch of bad guys while on a secret mission.

####  [`...balance`](#balance)
- Use the `...balance` command to check how much in-game currency you have. This is helpful for planning purchases in the shop or upgrades for your quests. Keep an eye on your balance to ensure you're ready for any new quests or items!
