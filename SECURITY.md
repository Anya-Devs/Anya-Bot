## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

2. **Submit via GitHub Issues**  
   Alternatively, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Anya-Devs/Anya-Bot/issues). For security-sensitive issues, **do not post the full details publicly**. Instead, provide a brief summary and request private follow-up.

3. **Expected Response Time**  
   - Initial response: Within **48 hours**.
   - Resolution timeline: Dependent on the severity and complexity of the issue, but typically within **14 days**.

## Security Issue Workflow

- Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will:
  1. Acknowledge the report and communicate the next steps.
  2. Investigate and reproduce the issue.
  3. Apply a patch and coordinate a release (if necessary).
  4. Credit the reporter, unless anonymity is requested.

## Scope of Security Concerns

The following types of issues are considered security concerns:
- Unauthorized access to user data.
- Exploits allowing privilege escalation within the bot or its servers.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party integrations used by Anya-Bot.

## Exclusions

The following are **not considered security vulnerabilities**:
- Bugs unrelated to security (please open a [standard issue](https://github.com/Anya-Devs/Anya-Bot/issues)).
- Server-specific configurations or mismanagement outside of Anya-Bot’s codebase.
- Outdated versions no longer supported.
