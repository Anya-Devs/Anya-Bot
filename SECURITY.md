## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in **Anya-Bot**, please follow the steps below:

### Steps to Report:
1. **Open an Issue**: 
   - Report the vulnerability by opening a new issue on our GitHub repository:  
     [https://github.com/Anya-Devs/Anya-Bot/issues](https://github.com/Anya-Devs/Anya-Bot/issues)
   
2. **Provide Details**:
   - Include a detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - If applicable, provide reproduction steps, potential impact, and any suggested mitigation.
   - Attach any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets to help us understand the issue.

3. **Security Label**:
   - When creating the issue, use the **"Security"** label (if possible) so we can prioritize the response.
   
### What to Expect:
- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your vulnerability report within 24 hours.
- **Updates**: You will receive updates as we investigate and resolve the issue. We aim to provide a status update every 3-5 days, depending on the complexity of the vulnerability.
- **Resolution**: If the vulnerability is verified, we will prioritize a patch and update the bot as soon as possible. A security advisory will also be issued if necessary.
- **Declined Reports**: If your report is declined (e.g., if it's not reproducible or is determined to be a non-issue), you will be notified with the reasoning.

### Best Practices for Security
- Always keep your dependencies up to date.
- Regularly review your botâ€™s permissions and limit them to only those necessary.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys directly in your codebase. Instead, use environment variables or configuration management systems.
